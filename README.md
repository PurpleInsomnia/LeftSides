# Friday Night Funkin' Left Sides.

An FNF Mod created, composed, animated, coded and yadayada by PurpleInsomnia

## Information

Left Sides is a FNF remix mod, used to tell the story of Ben and Tess.

Two best friends become lovers. As they both face problems in the present,
Both of them can't let go of their troubling past.

Face a number of opponents such as:
Her Parents.
Obsessed Childeren.
A Monster.
Lifelong Bully.
A Mentally Deranged Kid with Broken Humor.
...And Walter White?...

***LEFT SIDES CONTAINS SENSITIVE TOPICS SUCH AS:***
- _Depression_
- _Self Harm_
- _Abuse_
- _Suicide_

## DLC

Left Sides is planning to be given DLC at anytime.
If a DLC pack is released; a link will be posted here.

So far, one is built into the mod.

## Community
Left Sides can thrive on community made content.
So much so, you can do these things IN GAME!
- _Custom DLC PACKS_
- _FAN ART MENU_
- _A MENU WHERE YOU CAN VOTE FOR SONGS COMPOSED BY ME, PurpleInsomnia._
- **_AND SO MUCH MORE!!!_**

## Custom DLC Packs

Making custom DLC is quite simple, really.
(In fact, you can make an empty one from the DLC loading menu!)

Drop in your characters, songs, images, weeks, etc. And turn it on in the DLC loading menu.

In addition to scripting (Lua **and** Hscript), Left Sides DLC creation has some cool stuff like:
- _Stage Editor_ (V4.5+)
- _Custom Menus and Gameover Making With Hscript (Lua Support Maybe)_
- _Making Your Own Album For The Soundtrack Menu_
- _Custom UI Packs_
- **_AND MORE_**

# PERMISIONS.

### You are allowed to do the following:
- _Download this code_ (Obviously)
- _Showcase this mod_
- _Share this mod_

### You **_HAVE_** _TO ASK_ to do these:
- _Modify this mod and redistrubute the modified version of this mod on ANY site._
- _Use parts of this mod and redistribute the mod on ANY site_

### You _**CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**_ do these:
- _Making your own mod using this code (Forking, Copy + Pasting), and then releasing the mod under a different name_

(Example: BillyBobJoe forks LeftSides.
Okay, no biggie.

HOWEVER, if BillyBobJoe names the mod RightSides, modifys the assets (To the point where someone can't point at it and say; "This is obviously a moddified version of Left Sides"), 
only changes things in the code that say "Left Sides" to "Right Sides"...

Then this rule will be broken.

If I see a mod that has broken this rule, I **_will_** take it down with no hesitation. No excuses.)
