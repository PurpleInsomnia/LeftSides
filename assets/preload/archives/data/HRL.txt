[GVMT] requested a log on humans. So it's within my duty to blend in, score interviews and such.

Apparently they describe Fallen Prisoners like "The Monster" or "Haive" as viruses.

The humans blame the transmission of this "virus" as "genetics". However, Fallen Prisoners like the listed above
always attack their nearest Target. So it's only natural that they'd attack someone like a victim's parent/grandparent/mate/etc.

Humans have also claimed to have found a "patient zero" for what they call "Chronical Torture" (the virus) back in the 1980's.
We haven't sent a prisoner to Earth since Earth year 1935. Meaning that they're very incorrect.

Apparently The Monster tried to kill someone earlier in the Earth month "April"...and they failed?
I've never seen anything like this! 
The prey's name is "Bently". (Goes by "Ben" around friends/family). And I'll DEFINETLY keep eyes on him.

The Monster also seems to be losing touch with reality. Almost like The Mindscape is driving them insane...
We have lots to learn about The Mindscape, yes. But...something about Bently feels...different?

Just as I suspected, The Monster has figured out to extend their reaches from the depths of The Mindscape into other's brains.
Right now, they're still attached to Bently, but The Monster has figured out a way to contact his girlfriend (Basically a term humans use instead of terms we use like "mate"), Tess.

From the reports you sent about the research you did on The Mindscape, it seems that "wall with mad ramblings written in blood" you found IS in fact related to The Monster.
It's certain to say that they have gone COMPLETELY insane.

Huh...So The Traitor has finally killed somebody? Even after that whole 'Peace with All' bullshit, they kill someone?
This has to be a message I'm not getting...

The prey's name is "Peter Scott" (AKA "Pico"). Not a lot of information about the kill as of now...

I have now confirmed that The Monster once stayed inside the body of a 'Double E' employee. And decided to play around
with the surrounding humans by feeding them information about us. Yes, us.
After that, they decided to let the entire Double E team make a video game for The Monster use a character as a vessle.
The attempt was succesfull. They killed 40 humans before the public caught wind, and called back millions of copies of the video game; "Hating Simulator".

The US government took the entire staff of Double E, and questioned them.
Once they started rambling on about "aliens" (us) and our home galaxy. The Monster escaped from a human vessle, and murdered everyone in the building.

I belive that some part of The Monster still has knowledge of game making, and makes titles specifically made for their victims.
Sometimes even remaking Hating Simulator, over and over and over and over again, just because it keeps them busy...or to play tricks with their prey.
Once they finish a game, they sort off....make it appear in the prey's life. However, they always make the Double E staff take credit for everything.

It's a stretch, but it's totally possible. Knowing all the things you can already do in The Mindscape.

The reports of the Mindscape are flowing in very rapidly after the one sent on Y179-D501. Most of them are very concerning.
I suggest that [GVMT] gets the research team out of there, instantly.
Those loud roars, whispering, laughing, mocking, sharp pains are ALL signs that the research team is losing touch with reality.

But then again, what can we make of those team members that suddenly disappeared?

What if those are all real?
What if there are creatures hiding in the Mindscape?






What if The Monster is becoming a [GOD] in there?








AN ALIVE GOD.
KILLING THE VERY FABRIC OF REALITY.
SLOWLY AS THEY RIP ALL OUR BLOODY, BROKEN, WORTHESS BODIES APART.















IF BENTLY FUCKS UP. FUCKS UP AND CUTS TOO DEEP AGAIN...
