none|piss|After a long week of school, work and such; Tess and I deserve to have a nice, relaxing weekend together.|benKitchen|ben
none|piss|She wanted to walk over to the video store to rent a movie for us to watch. Fine by me, as I need the exercise...
none|piss|Tess is looking for something to eat for breakfast before heading out...However she seems to be having difficulties finding it...
benN|question|What'cha lookin' for?||default
tessN|hmph|Poptarts...I swear that we had a few left...
benN|the-rock|Huh...looks like we don't have any...
tessN|hmph|Can we...um...pick out some before or after the movie store?
benN|the-rock|You wanna walk all the way to the grocery store?
tessN|default|Can you keep up with me?
benN|scared|WAIT WE'RE RUNNING?!
tessN|laughing|Haha! Of course not! It's too cold for me to get my running gear on!
benN|confused|Fair.
benN|happy|-But yeah! I'm totally down to go all the way there if you are.
tessN|happy|Let's go then!
tessN|bruh|-But first we have to get ready...
none|piss|I just now remembered that the both of us are only in our bathrobes.||ben
benN|oh|Oh right- Forgot we weren't dressed for the day.||default
tessN|cute-blushing|Goofball...
tessN|cute-blushing|...
benN|oh|Huh, surprisingly warmer than I thought it'd be today...|outsideSnow
tessN|stop-being-cute|Still too cold for my hands though...
benN|the-rock|But you're not wearing mittens...
none|piss|We walk for a few mintutes before coming across a busy intersection.||ben
none|piss|Tess kisses me on the cheek while waiting for our turn to walk. Her lips are cold...but hey, a kiss is a kiss.
none|piss|I sqeeze her hand a bit before kissing her back.
tessN|happy|...||default
tessN|hmph|Hmm...what to get...Um...|store
tessN|happy|I dunno, Cookies and Cream I guess...
benN|happy|Cool! Do you need anything else?
tessN|happy|Ooh, we should get a six pack of cola for the movie!
benN|happy|Okay, but we'll have to divide it evenly...
tessN|hmph|Meanie...
benN|happy|Wha- I am just being fair, that's all...
tessN|cute-blushing|I'm just messin' with you, babe.
none|piss|We buy our things after making our way to self-checkout.|black|ben
none|piss|Tess grabs the bag after I finish paying.
benN|happy|Nah nah, lemme carry it.||default
tessN|happy|But you know the rules; You buy it, I carry it.
benN|sadness-combat|But I like being a gentleman...
tessN|oh|You can um...break into a poptart for me.
tessN|happy|You can have the other one though.
benN|oh|Oh, alright then.
tessN|cute-blushing|Thank you, babe...
tessN|cute-blushing|...
none|piss|Our morning walk continues in the cold. Thankfully, the video store is within close proximity to the grocery store.|outsideSnow|ben
none|piss|Besides our poptarts, a debate about which video game we should play over the weekend keeps us busy.
benN|oh|What about...Minecraft?||default
tessN|bruh|What is there to work on besides the iron farm?
benN|happy|I recall you wanting an area for your fox...
tessN|hmph|...I'm too lazy.
benN|happy|Dying Light?
tessN|hmph|Nooooo...It looks scaryyyyyy...
benN|happy|It's not THAT scary...
tessN|hmph|...
tessN|hmph|Will you promise to calm me down if I get scared while I play?..
benN|happy|I don't see why not.
none|piss|We arrive at the video store, excited to pick out a movie for tonight.|black|ben
none|piss|Tess and I made a deal saying that'd she would only play Dying Light IF she got to pick the movie.
none|piss|She seems to be having a hard time deciding what to pick. I mean, how could you not? You have hundreds of options.
none|piss|She's also picking out three movies she wants to see and then filtering them out before renting them.
tessN|default|Hey babe, I'm gonna use the restroom real quick.||default
benN|the-rock|You want me to wait here?
tessN|hmph|Hmmm....
tessN|happy|Yeah. I'll be back before you know it!
benN|happy|Okay!
none|piss|...||ben
none|piss|Huh. Tess usually isn't in the bathroom for this long.
none|piss|That, or this stupid but addicting puzzle game on my phone eats away at time slowly.
none|piss|I then finally see Tess' pretty hair move across the many rows of shelves.
benN|happy|Hey!||default
tessN|down|Hi...
none|piss|Tess' change of mood puts me off guard.||ben
none|piss|She clings onto one of my arms before hiding her face in my hoodie.
benN|oh|What's the matter?||default
tessN|down|I-I...
tessN|down|...maybe later...
benN|oh|Okay...
benN|oh|...You decided on more movies...?||default
tessN|down|...
none|piss|She points to one of the movies while hiding behind my hoodie.||ben
none|piss|I nod my head in agreement before putting the eliminated movies back.
none|piss|After a few minutes, we head over to checkout.
none|piss|I buy Tess some M&M's just so that she can take her mind off whatever happened for a while.
none|piss|We finally rent the movie and leave the confines of the video store. I also hand Tess her M&M's|outsideSnow
tessN|stop-being-cute|T-Thank you, babe...||default
none|piss|She gives me a kiss before I give her a big hug.||ben
benN|happy|I love you...
tessN|stop-being-cute|I love you too...
none|piss|...
none|piss|We both spend the rest of the day just relaxing.|benRoomNight|ben
none|piss|Tess' mood has improved too.
none|piss|I could tell that she was trying her best to take her mind of whatever's bothering her.
none|piss|Singing along to music while we cook, Drawing on her Ipad, Giving me loads of affection whenever she can...
none|piss|Stuff like that just gives her time to move away from stress.
none|piss|We've just finished the movie Tess picked out. We haven't seen it in...years. So it was nice to watch it again.
none|piss|Tess volunteers takes both of our plates down. I agree while stretching my body.
tessN|down|We can umm...talk about...w-what happened today. After I come back up...'kay?||default
benN|oh|...alright.
none|piss|...
none|piss|I try my best to to emotionally prepare myself for what I'm gonna talk about.|black|tess
none|piss|...It's always the days that are really good turn to shit.
none|piss|Was she...stalking us?
none|piss|I take a deep breath, washing that thought away before going upstairs.
none|piss|I walk my way upstairs, closing the door softly.|benRoomNight
none|piss|I kinda pace around our bedroom. Mostly because it helps me think.
none|piss|I finally stop in place, and turn around to face Ben.
tessN|down|So...I-I ran into my mom at the v-video store...||default
tessN|down|She started to do this whole f-fucking made up speech on how she's changed as a person...
tessN|concerned|I dunno. Just being...weirdly nice to me...
benN|the-rock|How so?
tessN|concerned|Uh....C-commenting on my quote: "new look". And...trying to set up a lunch date...
benN|what|weird....
tessN|concerned|Yeah...out of the o-ordinary.
tessN|concerned|And then she kept asking stuff like: "How is your boyfriend doing?" and "What's up with you two lately?".
benN|what|Is she...stalking us?
tessN|cringe|God- I hope not.
benN|what|Then why would she be at the video store? Don't your parents like, only use streaming services?
tessN|cringe|Y-yeah..
tessN|cringe|And then, out of the clear blue sky, she said:
tessN|concerned|I-"I'm"-
tessN|down|...god fucking damnit....
none|piss|Ben notices my tone through the words I just spoke while gritting my teeth.||tess
none|piss|He rushes over to calm me down, placing one of his hands on my back before rubbing it.
none|piss|I start to tear up, however I keep my composure just so that we both can be strong through this.
tessN|down|She-she wants to bring all the shit I left at their house over here tommorow.||default
tessN|down|I-I-I just froze there...and...she took silence as a yes- and....
tessN|down|fuck...I-I can't face her again....
tessN|down|I can't look at her without thinking if she's gonna call me some of the worst names in the book...
tessN|down|I'm gonna probably have another fucking nightmare tonight...
tessN|down|...A-a-and...
benN|oh|You want me to handle it?
tessN|down|You...r-really?
benN|ass|Yeah, I'll do the whole exchange.
tessN|down|...Ben...you're really the best person I've ever known.
tessN|down|P-please don't forget that....
tessN|down|...Um...I-I couldn't tell her...what she needed to get...
tessN|down-cry|So...this is probably gonna be a stupid question...but...
tessN|concerned|Could you um...t-text her...what I want to get?...I-I think I can remember her number...
benN|concerned|Um...sure...
