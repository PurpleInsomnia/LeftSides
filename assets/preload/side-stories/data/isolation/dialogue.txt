none|piss|I'm at Ben's house for the night, so the couch is 1000 times better than my bed.
none|piss|As I start to fall asleep, I start to think about Ben's mood today.
none|piss|He was smiling and laughing so much...for the first time in a long time...
none|piss|...It made me feel happy too...
none|piss|All these thoughts about the guy I like make me fall asleep quickly...

yTess|horrified|B-ben?
lonely|default|It was all my fault, wasn't it?
lonely|default|Did I drive my mom to putting a bullet into her head?
yTess|horrified|You're scaring me...
lonely|default|I'm glad you get a chance to wake up from this nightmare.
lonely|default|I bet that you would start crying from being terrified. And my worthless soul would comfort you.
lonely|default|...
lonely|default|I can't fucking wake up, Tess.
lonely|default|Every waking moment is PAIN and TORTURE.
lonely|default|And I'm TIRED of FAKING my happiness.
lonely|default|I WANT TO DIE, TESS.
lonely|default|I WANT TO STOP SUFFERING.
