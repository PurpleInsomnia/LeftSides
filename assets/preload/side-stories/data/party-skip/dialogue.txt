none|piss|Man, fuck Tess' dad.|city|ben
none|piss|We both deadass spend forty minutes of our precious time just to go to this stupid Thanksgiving party.
none|piss|And then I proceed to get fucking shot at, while Tess gets yelled at by none other than fucking Pico whatever-the-fuck-his-last-name-is.
none|piss|So now we are walking home to eat goddamn leftover Dominos instead of Turkey on Thanks-fuckin-giving.
none|piss|What a great time considering this is the first time Tess and I have seen eachother in two weeks.
none|piss|And if you ever so have to know why...We both got sick.
tess|hmph|So...it looks like we're gonna have to wait like ten to fifteen minutes for the car...||default
tess|default|Wanna kill some time or should we just sit on a bench?
ben|confused|Eh...what is there to do? Everything's closed....
tess|default|We could...
none|piss|Her eyes scan the area.||ben
tess|stop-being-cute|...Walk around the block...?||default
ben|happy|Seems better than stayin' here.
none|piss|...
ben|happy|I'll get pizza and maybe some corn ready...Um...Do you want to find something to watch?|benKitchenNight
tess|hmph|I kinda wanna help make corn...
tess|happy|It just seems fun to me when I'm doing it with you!
ben|the-rock|Buuuuut you're not implied to do so...
tess|happy|Buuuuut I insist.
none|piss|She mocks my voice while resting her head on my shoulders. A very usefull tactic that always makes her win the quarrel somehow..||ben
ben|heehee|I dunno...I think I might do it by myself...||default
tess|stop-being-cute|Pleeeeeease? I promise that I won't steal any bites...
ben|the-rock|Just like you did with the cookie dough?
tess|laughing|Hey! Cookie dough is good! But it's not the same thing as stealing bites of frozen corn.
ben|guilt|...
ben|happy|Yeah, makes sense.
none|piss|p
none|piss|Damn that funny turkey movie was right.|black|ben
none|piss|Pizza is tasty as hell...
none|piss|Tess even went for thirds this time...It's like she hasn't eaten in days..
none|piss|Food aside..
none|piss|We ended up just watching youtube videos.
none|piss|Mostly just listening into some "internet drama" from the past few days. Nothing too special. Tess then sits up...
tess|default|Hey babe?||default
ben|question|What's up?
tess|happy|I'm bored.
ben|happy|Hi bored, I'm Ben.
tess|bruh|Haha dude. You're picking what we get to do next.
ben|question|Hmmmmm....
ben|happy|Cuddles?
tess|oh-embarrassed|Oh-
tess|stop-being-cute|U-umm...yeah, that's cool with me...But I have to leave in a few hours...
tess|oh|...
tess|oh-embarrassed|Wwwhats with the look?
ben|happy|Nothin'. Just admiring how cute you are when you get embarrassed. :)
tess|embarrassed|...
none|piss|I think she died from embarrassment.||ben
ben|happy|Earth to Tess?||default
tess|embarrassed|sh-shut up.
none|piss|...
ben|guilt|Yikes. Looks cold out.|benHallwayNight
ben|the-rock|You sure you don't need a coat...?
tess|happy|Lemme borrow one of your hoodies, and then I'll consider.
ben|heehee|Deal.
none|piss|I fetch her my warmest hoodie from my closet because I am that concerned about her catching a cold...again.||ben
tess|happy|Smells like you.||default
ben|the-rock|That's not a bad thing, right?
tess|happy|Not at all!~
ben|happy|Okay, good!
ben|happy|Well, get home in one piece, call me whenever you want to, don't fall up the stairs and please don't scrape your knees like you did on Halloween...
tess|laughing|I was in a rush, goofball!
ben|heehee|M'kay, sure...
ben|happy|Okay, I love you lots.
tess|cute-blushing|I love you too.
none|piss|We start hugging...||ben
none|piss|...
none|piss|...A lot of time passes and Tess tightens her hug...
none|piss|...
none|piss|...Lots of time passes...
ben|the-rock|You okay...?||default
none|piss|...||ben
tess|pout|I don't want to go home, Ben.||default
tess|pout|I'm sure my parents are mad at me for skipping Thanksgiving...
tess|pout|I just...I just don't want to deal with them today...
tess|tears|...
tess|tears|Please don't let me go...
ben|oh|Hey...It's okay...I won't let you go if you don't want to...
ben|confused|...pardon my french but your Dad is a hard-ass...
tess|tears|Thank you...
none|piss|...
none|piss|Well, Tess is staying here tonight...|benRoomNight|ben
none|piss|She didn't want to deal with her parents while they were mad...
none|piss|...
none|piss|...Something feels...off...about that...
none|piss|...Like, she isn't telling me something...
none|piss|...I dunno...seems fishy...
none|piss|I should ask just incase...
ben|question|Hey babe...?||default
tess|oh|Yeah?
ben|guilt|Is there...something that you aren't telling me...?
none|piss|...
tess|concerned|...Umm...No...why?
ben|guilt|...
ben|guilt|...Nevermind...
none|piss|Guess I am just being overprotective again...||ben
tess|concerned|Umm...g-goodnight...
ben|oh|Oh, heading to bed already?
ben|oh|I thought you were just putting my hoodie back..
tess|concerned|I'm just...really tired...It's been long day for me...
tess|concerned|Uhh...you don't have to go to bed now if you don't want to....
tess|stop-being-cute|You can umm...Be big-spoon when you decide to go to bed...
ben|oh|Okay...I'll just be doing chores downstairs...Holler if you need me.
ben|concerned|I love you...
tess|concerned|I love you too...
none|piss|I crouch down and give her a kiss, causing a small but noticable smile on her face..||ben
tess|concerned|If I'm gone tomorrow, then it's because I went home to do packing for winter break...||default
tess|cute-blushing|You know I like to pack stuff ASAP...
ben|happy|Noted.
ben|happy|Sweet dreams...
none|piss|...
none|piss|...The moment I wake up, I'm off to pack EVERYTHING I need...|black|tess
none|piss|...Guitar, Laptop shit, clothes...everything I can carry...
none|piss|I just...can't take it anymore...
none|piss|Fucking stupid...Why didn't I tell him anything?!
none|piss|Am I that scared?!?!?!
none|piss|...Then again...Dad is fully capable of doing...what he said he'd do if I told anyone...
none|piss|Fuck...I'm just glad Ben's letting me stay...
none|piss|I love him so...much...
none|piss|...
none|piss|...Tess is fast asleep...|benRoomNight|ben
none|piss|From the bags under her eyes today, It looked like she hasn't slept in days...
none|piss|I mean- 9 in the evening isn't a normal bed time for either of us, but good for her on going to bed so early...
none|piss|I hope everything's going okay for her mentally...
none|piss|I mope my way into bed slowly..
none|piss|I accidentally bump into the night stand on my now declared side of our bed in my tired state.
none|piss|Tess of course hears this and sits up quickly, and appears alert in a matter of a second.
none|piss|Her sharp inhale startles me.
ben|oh|It's okay, It's just me...Sorry about that...||default
tess|concerned|Oh. Y-yeah you're fine...
ben|the-rock|You okay?
tess|oh|Huh? Oh- y-y-yeah I'm okay...J-just...a weird dream...
ben|oh|Okay...I'm hittin' the hay right now..so...good night...again...
tess|concerned|I love you.
ben|comfort|Love you...too...
none|piss|His voice trails off to silence as he weakly wraps his arms around my lower-torso, Just like how we always cuddle...|black|tess
none|piss|...This is so...
none|piss|...comforting...
none|piss|Like he's protecting me from everything, with his arms around me...
none|piss|I don't think I've ever started to drift off so fast...ever...
none|piss|...
none|piss|Ah yes, the rain.|benRoomRain|ben
none|piss|How I hate it when it wakes me up.
none|piss|...
none|piss|Looks like Tess is gone...
none|piss|A piece of paper is on my night stand.
none|piss|It has a reading of "Thank you for letting me stay the night, I love you lots!" with a few hearts surrounding the words signed by Tess.
none|piss|It sits next to a plate of bagels and butter.
none|piss|I shoot her a text, thanking her for the note and breakfast-almost-lunch.
none|piss|She reponds with the selfie she took of us yesterday. Along with a message saying that she had a lot of fun yesterday, despite all the gun fire and stuff...
none|piss|We plan a shopping "date" two days before our dinner date because I told her I didn't really have a good shirt...
none|piss|After talking a bit about the stuff we should buy, we end our conversation by planning a video call later tonight.
none|piss|I have an energy drink before making my way to my office, these videos aren't gonna make themselves.
none|piss|But throughout the day...I can't really take my mind of Tess' mood yesterday...
none|piss|She just seemed really...down.
none|piss|...I just have a funny feeling that I'm not getting the full scoop...
none|piss|I really hope everything is going okay for her...
