ben|question|So, who's your favorite character so far?|benKitchenNight
tess|hmph|Umm....
tess|default|I dunno....Probably Jesse...
tess|hmph|I kinda feel bad for him to be honest..
tess|cute-blushing|His goofiness reminds me of you as well.
ben|heehee|Wait 'till you get to season two and three. A lot of cool characters are revealed.
tess|cute-blushing|Cool...
none|piss|Tess and I just finished watching the first episode of Breaking Bad (With dinner, as we planned)||ben
none|piss|...Well I mean....I just finished rewatching. This is Tess' first time watching it...
none|piss|Just overall a really good Saturday.
none|piss|I start to do the dishes (Definetly not because the sink is kinda overflowing.)
ben|oh|Oh no, I've got it..||default
tess|cute-blushing|But I wanna help!
ben|happy|Okay....but just so you know, you're not obligated to do so.
tess|cute-blushing|Okay...
none|piss|p
tess|oh|Hey babe, what are we gonna do for breakfast tomorrow?
ben|confused|Damn, I dunno..
ben|happy|You pick.
tess|cute-blushing|How about pancakes? I've never tried them before..
ben|happy|Yeah, pancakes sound good!
ben|fake-smile|...pretty good...
none|piss|Pancakes...||ben
none|piss|...It's been almost a year...
none|piss|...
none|piss|...I just made pancakes while being extremely tired...
none|piss|There was this loud bang that woke me up last night. Kept me up cause I thought there was like an active shooter in the neighborhood..
none|piss|Mom will probably freak if I tell her that though...
none|piss|Speaking of which, when the hell is she gonna get up?
none|piss|I start walking towards her room.||otherBenHall
yBen|default|Mom! You up yet?||default
none|piss|No response.||ben
none|piss|I knock on the door.
none|piss|Still nothing.
none|piss|I didn't want it to come to this, but I have no choice.
none|piss|I open the door
none|piss|Ben?||dark
none|piss|Ben?
tess|concerned|Ben?|benKitchenNight|default
ben|oh|Huh?
tess|oh|You've been washing your hands for a minute and a half now..
tess|concerned|You okay?
ben|guilt|...
none|piss|I say nothing. I just walk to my room, trying my best not to have Tess see a river of tears fall from my eyes.||ben
none|piss|I don't like it when she sees me cry. It makes her upset...and then we both start crying...
none|piss|...It's all my fault...
none|piss|...
none|piss|...What's up with him?....|none|tess
none|piss|...It's not like him to just...leave my presence without saying anything...
none|piss|I half huridely, half carefully walk up the stairs to talk to him...
none|piss|I stand in the already open door frame..|benRoomNight
none|piss|He's sobbing out into a pillow..
none|piss|I rush over to him in a panicked state.
tess|panic|Hey hey, what's wrong?!||default
none|piss|He only looks up at me for a breif second before going back to crying....||tess
none|piss|However, now that I'm in the room he seems a lot more calm...
none|piss|I start to cry silently with him..
none|piss|I sit down on the bed with him and hold his hand before asking him if he wanted to watch a movie to take his mind off of what he's sad about.
none|piss|He nods "yes" while squeezing my hand a bit, his face is still burried in a pillow.
none|piss|...
none|piss|...The movie seemed to help...Ben sniffs, wipes his eyes, sits up and exhales slowly.
ben|tears|Sorry for just...leaving....||default
ben|tears|...
none|piss|He starts bouncing one of his knees.||tess
ben|tears|...I....I made pancakes the morning my mom died...I know, its a really stupid fucking reason to cry...||default
tess|tears|It's not a dumb reason...
tess|tears|...I'm really sorry that I brought it up....
ben|tears|It's okay...You didn't know about that....
none|piss|He exhales..||tess
ben|tears|...Wanna hit the hay?||default
tess|cute-blushing|Okay....
none|piss|Ben walks downstairs to hit the lights. When he comes back up, he only takes off his socks before he lies down.||tess
none|piss|I give him a "it's okay" smile before I change.
none|piss|As I fall asleep in Ben's arms, I can't help but think about what he was thinking about during that minute and a half...|none
none|piss|Is he still...
none|piss|...No, cut it out Tess...
none|piss|...I know he doesn't like to talk about his feelings and stuff...but..
none|piss|...I'm just worried about him...
none|piss|...
