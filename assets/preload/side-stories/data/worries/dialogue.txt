none|piss|Yep, looks like I got everything...
none|piss|...
none|piss|Jeez, I can't believe I'm getting married to the girl of my dreams in just a few days...
none|piss|Almost feels like a dream to me...like, how lucky am I to spend the rest of my life with an amazing woman like her?
none|piss|I start pushing my shopping cart full of stuff we both need for our trip up towards self-checkout.
none|piss|I make a quick stop for ice cream though. Figured that I want to give Tess a little treat.
none|piss|After putting a small, ice cold tub of Cookies & Cream in my cart. I actually make my way over to self-checkout.
none|piss|!
none|piss|I pull out my phone to see that Tess has texted me something.
none|piss|.
none|piss|I put my phone away, quickly get what Tess needed me to get. And then finally (for real this time), I check out my items.
none|piss|Before driving off, I shoot Tess a quick text saying I'm gonna get gas for the drive tommorow.|black
none|piss|...
benN|happy|Hey babe, I'm home!|benHallwayNight|default
none|piss|Hi baby!
none|piss|I smile after hearing Tess' soft voice greet me, leaving me to half-ass put away the groceries because we're pilling them all into the car tommorow anyways.||ben
none|piss|After that, I run upstairs to give Tess her ice cream. Mostly thinking about how big her smile will be.
none|piss|...
benN|heehee|Boop.|benRoomNight|default
none|piss|I boop Tess' nose before giving her her ice cream. Which gives her a slight but noticable blush.||ben
tessN|laughing|Awwwwww...Thank you baby...||default
tessN|default|You should get another spoon so that we can share!
benN|the-rock|But I got this just for you though.
tessN|hmph|But now I feel guilty that I'm eating this delicious ice cream in front of youuuu...
none|piss|She holds out a small spoonful for me to eat. I give in, and proceed to eat her sample.||ben
none|piss|I quickly steal the spoon from her to get another bite.
tessN|laughing|Bently Morgan Warner!
benN|heehee|I changed my mind.~
none|piss|I give her a small kiss before getting a spoom for myself.||ben
none|piss|...
none|piss|Going from eating ice cream together to watching a show while cuddled up is the coolest thing that's happened to me today so far.
none|piss|Tess is starting to get a little sleepy though...I sometimes see her eyes get heavy...
none|piss|But, it's okay. At least the show's over now. Tess sits up and stretches for a bit, and then falls back into my arms.
tessN|cute-blushing|We've gotta get to bed...you especially, mister.||default
benN|oh|Why?
tessN|wink|Cause you're driving first tommorow, that's why.

tessN|hair-down-shy|...w-wanna...join me?
benN|blush|Say no more...
none|piss|...
benN|question|So, do you wanna set the alarm, or should I?
none|piss|I think you should, I don't feel like waking up to my alarm sound haha.
none|piss|Tess comes out of the bathroom to find me setting up an alarm on my phone.||ben
none|piss|She tosses me a pair of clean boxers, all while she's trying to find something to wear to bed.
benN|blush|You can uhm...wear one of my shirts if you want...||default
tessN|hair-down|Yay!~
none|piss|Tess moves to the other side of the closet to pick out one of my shirts, Eventually settling on my simple black t-shirt.||ben

none|piss|I turn on my phone and see that it's 3:27.
none|piss|I pull myself out of bed and walk over to the bathroom half asleep.
none|piss|As I do my business in there, I read a couple of news articles. Yeah, they're boring, but they keep me from falling asleep.
none|piss|I finish, wash my hands, and leave the bathroom quietly.
none|piss|Which I then notice that the light for the office is on.
none|piss|...weird.
none|piss|I then see that Tess isn't in my bed and I instantly put two and two together.
none|piss|I approach the door and softly knock on it.
none|piss|Yeah?||default
benN|concerned|Can I come in?
none|piss|sure...
none|piss|I enter the office slowly to find Tess sitting down on the couch in there, watching a movie on her phone.
none|piss|She's huddled up in a few blankets, and is squeezing her stress-ball over and over again.
benN|concerned|What's going on?||default
none|piss|I sit down next to her. And now that I'm closer to her, I can see that she has been crying.||ben
none|piss|She turns off her phone, sets her stress-ball down and sits up a bit more.

tessN|down|I opened it and...there...
tessN|down-cry|There was 3 people in there...and they were ALL suffering...some horrifying fate...
tessN|down-cry|I-I watched one of them hang themselves...another had the most horrifying smile I've ever seen, and they were in a pile of their own blood...
tessN|down-cry|And the last one...
tessN|down-cry|They sounded like a little kid...
tessN|down-cry|And they were screaming...''I don't want to die'' over and over and over...
none|piss|I wrap my arms around Tess, and give her stress-ball to her so that she can calm down a bit.||ben
tessN|down-cry|And then...I-I heard this...laughter...It just kept getting louder and louder...||default
tessN|down-cry|...Something red also spread throughout my entire body...like a crack...
tessN|down-cry|All that, and I saw my dad at the end of the hall, approaching me slowly...
tessN|down-cry|I couldn't do anthing except to just curl up into a ball and scream...
tessN|down-cry|My dad grabbed me...a-and pulled me out of the room...
tessN|down|...Like it was nothing...
tessN|down-cry|...My dad...threw me to the ground...and stompped on my head until my vision went red...and then I just...woke up...
none|piss|Horrified, I try to comfort her while trying to play off that I'm not at all freaked the fuck out by her nightmare.||ben
benN|concerned|It's okay...It's okay...it's just a dream...no matter how real it was...I'm ALWAYS here to protect you.||default

tessN|comfort|You make EVERYTHING more than perfect for me...I don't care if you mess up even a tiny bit...I'm still gonna love you at the end of the day...

tessN|comfort|You're the most strong, intellegent, empathetic, and loving person I've met in my entire life...||default
tessN|comfort-cry|And..if your parents were still here with us...they'd be so...so proud of you.

tessN|comfort-cry|...T-The point is: I love you no matter what...and I'm so happy I get to spend the rest of my life with you...
none|piss|I try my best not to cry, but seeing Tess' violet eyes filled with comfort and trust ultimately break me.||ben
none|piss|Tess rubs my shoulders as I let my emotions out while she's constantly saying that she loves me.
none|piss|I kinda settle down after a few minutes.

tessN|down-cry|I...I want to be a good mom...but, I don't know how...
tessN|down-cry|...Whenever I think of my parents I just think: screaming matches, beatings, relentless bullying...y'know...their ususal bullshit...

none|piss|Tess hugs me while we both silently cry.||ben
none|piss|I ask her if she wants to go back to bed, to which she nods ''yes.''
none|piss|I guide her back to bed, and crawl in with her.
